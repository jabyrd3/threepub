> vuejs epub reader
it's really dumb that there isn't an open source epub reader that works across ios, android, chrome, osx, windows and linux and uses dropbox for syncing. So ima make one. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run unit tests
npm test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
